<h1>Chip in to Save the World</h1>
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
The methane emissions from the Arctic may already be enough to doom humanity even if
we drop our carbon emissions to zero now.

<h2>The Big Project</h2>
<p>
    Grow algae, turn it into charcoal, recycle the nutrients, remediate the water
    outflow, pile up the carbon.
</p>
<h2>The Immediate Project</h2>
<p>
    The big unknown is recycling phosphorus, which is a limiting factor in the
    biosphere.  The immediate project is a couple of undergrads (under supervision)
    growing algae, turning it into charcoal, and doing chemical analyses on the
    results, with a particular focus on phosphorus and its compounds.
</p>
<h2>The Organizations</h2>
<h3>Fundraising</h3>
<p>
    Fundraising will need to happen on a large scale.  Both direct fundraising and
    large foundations like Google and Bill Gates.

</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>
    The research organization will both fund and pursue research.
</p>
<h3>Advocacy</h3>
<p>
    There is much advocacy work to be done on this project.
</p>
<p>
    The first useful thing that will happen will be carbon offsets.  Right now
    this mechanism is not covered under offset agreements.  Advocacy will be required
    to change that.
</p>
<h3>Operations</h3>
<p>
    Large scale, and not happening soon.
